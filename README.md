# Deep-Sequential-Portfolio-Optimization-via-CNN-Filtering-and-Sharpe-Ratio-Maximization
Two-stage DL for dynamic European portfolio optimization. CNN filters stocks, and LSTM maximizes the Sharpe Ratio via a custom loss function. Uses Walk-Forward Optimization (WFO) for backtesting. This notebook is not a financial advisor.
